# FirstDrafter
*A pair of tools enabling novelists to write their first draft the way it's meant to be written:*  
*without abandon, without editing, and without looking back*

There are two versions of this app, each for a different purpose:
- `writer-helper`: for writers who begin with a premise or an opening scene, and
- `start-at-the-end`: for writers who begin with the ending.

For simplicity, both are called FirstDrafter.

More details to come soon.

## Features:
- When you run FirstDrafter on Mac Terminal and you use the arrow keys, you get weird outputs (a combination of the A, B, C, D keys and symbols), and that is enough to discourage you from looking back and editing your previous written work.

## Known issues:
- ### Please don't use double or triple asterisks because they will mess up your first draft.
   If your input content includes a series of asterisks, say \*\* or \*\*\* or more, a horrible thing happens: instead of what you type, all the files in the same directory as writing-helper.sh will be inputted to your work-in-progress. So, just in case your work contains sensitive content, please refrain from using asterisks. Otherwise, you will be puzzled at the appearance of strange file names in your draft.
